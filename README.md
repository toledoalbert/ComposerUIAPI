ComposerUIAPI
=============

This repo hosts an eclipse project where I keep all the data structures written in Java to represent
the Tekkotsu code components.

I also started messing around with a gui with no drag/drop to allow users to generate code without typing input
to the console and actually pretty cool ui coming along.

To run it, you can basically clone to your computer and import as an eclipse project.
